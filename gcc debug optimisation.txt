maximum degug info = -O0 -g3

-O:
optimisation level
-O0 = no optimisation.

-g:
Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions present in the program. Some debuggers support macro expansion when you use -g3.
The broader answer is that gcc supports four levels of debug information, from -g0 (debug information disabled) through -g3 (maximum debug information).
(-g = derfault level -g2)
